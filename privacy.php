    <p>
        Personally identifiable information ("PII") may includes your full name, address,
        telephone number, and email address that you submit on this Site. You may submit
        PII to the Site in one of the following (non-exhaustive) ways:</p>
    <p>
        (a) Contact Us</p>

        If you email us through Contact Us link on this Site or from an email, we ask you
        to add information such as your name and email address in order to respond to your
        questions and concerns. We will only use this information to respond to your inquiry,
        unless you authorize additional use of your information.</p>
    <p>
        (b) Subscriber Information</p>
    <p>
        We collect personally identifiable information about our Subscribers, [1] based
        on: information gathered at the time of registration, Subscriber interaction and
        response to subsequent electronic mailings and web site use, information provided
        by our Clients, and information appended from data aggregators. Information collected
        may include name, email address, postal address, gender, birth date, telephone number,
        cell phone number, activities, interests, user behavior, and other demographic information.
        This information enables us to better tailor our content to Subscribers' needs and
        to help our Clients promote and sell their products and services. The only information
        that is collected is the information identified in this Privacy Policy.</p>
    <p>
        Non-Personally Identifiable Information</p>
    <p>
        When you visit this Site, we also collect certain aggregate and non-personally identifiable
        information ("Non-PII"), as described below. This information does not relate to
        a single identifiable visitor instead it assists us in tracking user traffic on
        this Site and what pages were accessed.</p>
    <p>
        Web Beacons</p>
    <p>
        Pages on our Site may contain "web beacons" (also known as Internet tags, pixel
        tags and clear GIFs). Web beacons allow third parties to obtain information such
        as the IP address of the computer that downloaded the page on which the beacon appears,
        the URL of the page on which the beacon appears, the time the page containing the
        beacon was viewed, the type of browser used to view the page, and the information
        in cookies set by the third party. We use log files to store the data that is collected
        through web beacons.</p>
    <p>
        Cookie Information</p>
    <p>
        A cookie is a small amount of data, which often includes an anonymous unique identifier
        that is sent to your browser from a web site's computer and stored on your computer's
        hard drive. Cookies record information about your online preferences. Cookies let
        us know about repeat visitors and if we are delivering quality products and services
        to our Clients. We may also use cookies to identify which sites our repeat visitors
        are coming from, so that we can place more of our online advertising on these sites,
        and can, where necessary, pay our affiliates and other business partners. Each web
        site can send its own cookie to your browser if your browser's preferences allow
        it, but (to protect your privacy) your browser only permits a web site to access
        the cookies it has already sent to you, not the cookies sent to you by other sites.
        Many sites do this whenever a user visits their website in order to track online
        traffic flows.</p>
    <p>
        You can set your browser to accept all cookies, to notify you when a cookie is issued,
        or not to receive cookies at any time. Each browser is different, so check the "Help"
        menu of your browser to learn how to change your cookie preferences. For further
        information on cookies please visit http://www.aboutcookies.org.</p>
    <p>
        User Profiles</p>
    <p>
        The Company may aggregate PII, Non-PII, Log File information, Web Beacon Information,
        and Cookie Information in order to create a profile of a user or users of the Site.</p>
    <p>
        Children's Privacy</p>
    <p>
        This Site is not directed to children under the age of eighteen and we do not knowingly
        collect personal information from children under the age of eighteen on this Site.

        to Survey Information, (2) to track an individual's web browsing habits, (3) to
        determine which areas of our sites are most frequently visited. This information
        helps the Company to better understand the online habits of users so that the Company

        Global Data Processing and Safe Harbor Principles</p>
    <p>
        The information that we collect from you may be transferred to, stored at and processed
        at a destination outside of the U.S. By submitting your personal information, you
        agree to this transfer, storage and processing. Where the privacy laws of these
        countries are not as comprehensive as those in the US, we will take steps to ensure
        that your privacy rights are respected.</p>
    <p>
        In order to bridge the different privacy approaches between the U.S. and the European
        Union, the U.S. Department of Commerce, in consultation with the European Commission,
        developed a "Safe Harbor" framework. We adhere to the Safe Harbor framework, which
        includes the privacy principles of Notice, Choice, Onward Transfer, Access and Accuracy,
        Security, and Oversight/Enforcement. We are currently seeking participation in the
        Safe Harbor program. To learn more about the Safe Harbor, click here.</p>
