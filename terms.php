                and agreements, whether written or oral, as to such subject matter. Nothing contained
                in these Terms will be deemed to constitute either party as the agent or representative
                of the other party, or both parties as joint venturers or partners for any purpose.</li>
            <li>Limitation of Actions You agree that any claim or cause of action arising out of
                your use of the Site or these Terms must be filed within one year after such claim
                or cause of action arose or it shall forever be barred, notwithstanding any statute
                of limitations or other law to the contrary. Within this period, any failure by
                Company to enforce or exercise any provision of these Terms or related right shall
